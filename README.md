6. Make a new folder and name it your NETID
7. copy the files from this weeks PSet directory into the NETID folder

9. When you are ready to submit, type into console, (after making sure you are in the proper the directory) and only for the first time run: ```git remote add https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/submissions.git origin```
10. Following that (in the same directory), add your changes files to be staged for a commit, and commit your changes:
```git add [FILE]```
```git commit -m "PSET submission"```
11. then run ```git push origin master``` (you may need to ```git pull``` to catch up to master)
12. On github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Submissions, click the button for a new pull request (on the right sidebar) 
13. To the complete the new pull request: set the base fork HEAD to cs196illinois:submissions and the head fork HEAD to [yourGithubID]:master
14. Once you are done with the pull request, PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK!!!
15. wait for a response (either accepting or rejecting the merge). Poke your Course Assistant if it takes more than a few hours.

Repeat steps 10 through 15 for subsequent PSets!
